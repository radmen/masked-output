Because I hate masked passwords

# why ?

Some applications require to input only selected characters from password.  

I find this cumbersome. Specially for hard passwords.

I hate it.

That's why I created this simple script - it accepts password and list of characters from password.  
As an output it will display the requested fields from password.

# installation

```
npm i -g @radmen/masked-output
```
