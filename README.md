Because I hate masked passwords

# why ?

Some applications require to input only selected characters from password.  

I find this cumbersome. Specially for hard passwords.

I hate it.

That's why I created this simple script - it accepts password and list of characters from password.  
As an output it will display the requested fields from password.

# installation

```bash
npm i -g @radmen/masked-output
```

# usage

```bash
masked-output
```

# demo

# use it on your own risk!

This is a simple script. Nothing fancy. I don't take any responsibility for it ;)
